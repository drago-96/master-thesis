The main goal of this thesis is to study isogeny-based cryptography, and in particular some proposed Oblivious Transfer protocols.

OT protocols are a fundamental building block for Multi-Party Computation, thus having an efficient and post-quantum secure protocol is of great importance.

We will introduce the basic concepts of isogeny-based cryptography, of Universal Composability security and classical OT protocols. Then we will describe some proposed OT protocols which are based on isogeny crypto, analyzing efficiency and security for each one of them.

(maybe?) a new protocol!
