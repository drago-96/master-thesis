# Isogeny-based Oblivious Transfer Protocols

This repo contains my Master's thesis in Mathematics.

The main subjects are isogeny-based cryptography and security definitions for multi-party computation. In particular, we will deal with oblivious transfer protocols, their realization from isogenies and their security in the universal composability framework.

Many thanks to Manuela and Cyprien, who guided me during this project and helped me countless times in understanding the world of UC security. A special thanks to Davide, for his very precise proofreading and much much more.

Also a great thank you to the Cryptohack community for helping me learn and discuss cryptography, and in particular to Lorenz for his great insights about isogeny crypto.
